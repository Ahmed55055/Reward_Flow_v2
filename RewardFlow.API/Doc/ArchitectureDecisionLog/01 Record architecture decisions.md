# **1. Record architecture decisions**

---
Date: 4-8-2023

### **Problem**
---

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project and store it as close to code as possible.

### **Decision**
---

We will use the concept of Architecture Decision Records, as \[described by Michael Nygard]
(http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

And used by \[Evolutionary architecture]
(https://github.com/evolutionary-architecture/evolutionary-architecture-by-example).

### **Consequences**
---

* Every time new architecture decision comes in, it is required to add new architecture decision record
	  
* Existing architecture decision records are immutable. Whenever there is a need to update old record, a new one is created
